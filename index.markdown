Welcome!

![](/assets/images/woodpecker.jpg)

I'm an MD/PhD student in the [UNC Medical Scientist Training Program](https://www.med.unc.edu/mdphd/).

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Health Economics in the [Department of Health Policy and Management](https://sph.unc.edu/hpm/health-policy-and-management-home/) in the Gillings School of Global Public Health at UNC.

When not working, I can be found in the woods trying (and often failing) to take pictures of birds.
