## Health and Labor Economics

I'm interested in how health, employment, and socioeconomic status interact within and across families. 

One line of questioning involves child health and development in the context of a family unit:
* How does child health and illness affect parental labor market outcomes?
* How does family socioeconomic status affect child health and development?

Another direction involves the organization and financing of Medicaid. North Carolina has recently transitioned to Medicaid managed care.
* How did the transition to Medicaid managed care affect provider participation and payments?
* Is competition between managed care plans an effective force in keeping down costs and improving quality?

## Public Policy and Biomedical Ethics

I'm driven by questions of distributive and productive justice of health and health care, including
* What level of health are we "owed"?
* Who ought to produce health care, and for what cost?
